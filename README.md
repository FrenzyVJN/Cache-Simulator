**Cache Simulator**

### Introduction
This Cache Simulator project was developed as part of the Computer Organization and Architecture (COA) course in our first year at college. The aim of this project was to implement a cache simulator in order to understand the fundamentals of memory hierarchies, caching mechanisms, and their impact on computer performance.

### Project Overview
The Cache Simulator is designed to emulate the behavior of a cache memory system. It simulates the interactions between the CPU, cache, and main memory, providing insights into cache hit/miss rates, cache configurations, and overall system performance.

### Features
1. **Cache Simulation**: The simulator implements L1 and L2 caches along with a victim cache for efficient memory access.
2. **Random and Manual Address Input**: Users can either generate random memory addresses or manually input addresses to simulate cache operations.
3. **Realistic Memory Simulation**: The simulator generates a simulated main memory filled with random integers for realistic cache interactions.
4. **Visualization**: Visual representation of memory, L1 cache, L2 cache, and victim cache allows users to understand cache behavior visually.
5. **Statistics Display**: Real-time display of cache hits and misses for both L1 and L2 caches, providing insights into cache performance.

### How to Use
To use the Cache Simulator, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/FrenzyVJN/Cache-Simulator.git
   ```
2. **Open the Simulator**: Navigate to the project directory and open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the Cache Simulator.
3. **Input Generation**: Generate random memory addresses by clicking the "Random" button or manually input addresses in binary format.
4. **Simulation**: Upon inputting an address, the simulator processes the address and simulates cache operations, displaying cache hits, misses, and accessed data.
5. **Analysis**: Analyze the displayed statistics to understand cache performance and behavior under different memory access patterns.
6. **Experimentation**: Experiment with different memory access patterns and cache configurations to observe their impact on cache performance.

### Dependencies
- This simulator is a self-contained JavaScript application and does not require any external dependencies or libraries.

### Deployment
- The Cache Simulator is deployed on vercel and can be used for educational purposes.
```

```
### Future Enhancements
- Support for configurable cache parameters such as cache size, associativity, and replacement policies.
- Integration with additional cache levels to simulate more complex memory hierarchies.
- Enhanced visualization features for better understanding of cache behavior.
